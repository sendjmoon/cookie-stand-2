          <div class="article-line"></div>
          <p> From West Philadelphia born and raised on the playground where I spent most of my days. Chillin' out, maxin', relaxin all cool we were shootin' some b-ball outside of the school when a couple of guys who were up to no good started makin' trouble in my neighborhood. I got in one little fight and my mom got scared and said, "You're movin' with your auntie and uncle in Bel-Air." </p>
